      <div class="prose">
        <p>Most people live completely disconnected from where their food comes from. We buy shrink-wrapped fish without ever seeing the ocean, eat mushrooms without knowing what a forest floor smells like. That disconnection makes it easy to not care about the ecosystems that sustain us.</p>

        <p>Eat Wild is built on a simple belief: meaningful connections between people and nature inspire people to understand their dependence on the natural world. When you forage your own chanterelles, dive for your own uni, or cook over a fire with ingredients you gathered that morning — something shifts. You start paying attention. You start caring.</p>

        <p>We run sustainable wild food experiences that get people out of the kitchen and into the tide pools, the forests, and the coastline of Northern California. But it goes deeper than just foraging walks. We're actively researching sea urchin ranching using recirculating aquaculture systems in urban settings, with future investigations into underwater drone-based population management — working on ocean conservation from the inside out.</p>

        <p>Founded with Ellen Scott-Young, Eat Wild sits at the intersection of food, conservation, and community. The goal isn't just to eat wild — it's to build a relationship with the wild that makes you want to protect it.</p>
