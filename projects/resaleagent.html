      <div class="prose">
        <p>Selling stuff secondhand is painful. Flaky buyers, lowballers, ghosting, and endless back-and-forth scheduling. Half the time you end up giving things away for free just to be done with it. And as a buyer, it's not much better — sellers go dark, scheduling is a nightmare, and simple transactions drag on for days.</p>

        <p>Resale Agency solves all of that. It manages listings on your behalf — posting for you, syncing across platforms, and cleaning up postings after an item is sold. No more juggling Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and OfferUp separately.</p>

        <p>When buyers message, the agent handles it automatically. It negotiates using your asking price and minimum price to work toward an offer, and schedules sales and pickups based on your defined availability. You only hear about it when the right buyer at the right price locks in — making the whole process seamless and async.</p>

        <p>You set your prices, your schedule, and your rules. Resale Agency does the rest.</p>
