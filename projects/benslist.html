      <div class="prose">
        <p>I kept a Google Maps list of every restaurant I loved. Hole-in-the-wall spots, neighborhood favorites, the places you only find by walking past them. The list kept growing.</p>

        <p>Then people started asking. "Where should I eat in LA?" "What's good in SF?" Friends, friends of friends, coworkers — my phone turned into a restaurant hotline. Sometimes I wouldn't answer for days. Sometimes I'd forget. And I definitely didn't want to hand out my number to the whole world just so they could ask me where to eat.</p>

        <p>So I built <a href="https://benslist.food" target="_blank">benslist.food</a> — an AI chatbot that knows my entire restaurant list. Ask it anything — "best tacos in LA", "dim sum in SF", "where to eat near Koreatown" — and it pulls from my curated picks.</p>

        <div class="how-built">
          <strong>How it's built:</strong> Next.js app hosted on Vercel. My restaurant list lives as a CSV (~260 places with tags, descriptions, and recommended dishes). When you ask a question, the full list gets loaded into context and GPT streams back a recommendation with Google Maps links. The chat UI uses Vercel's AI SDK for real-time streaming. There's even a donate button if you loved the rec.
        </div>

        <p>Still eating, still adding. Still removing the spots that fell off. The list is alive — and now anyone can search it.</p>
